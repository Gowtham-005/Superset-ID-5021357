1. Array Representation:
   Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory where elements are stored. They provide fast access to elements based on index, which is beneficial for certain types of operations.

2. Time Complexity Analysis:
   - Add Employee: O(1) if there is space in the array; otherwise, O(n) if resizing is needed.
   - Search Employee: O(n) as it may require checking each element.
   - Traverse Employees: O(n) because each element needs to be visited.
   - Delete Employee: O(n) as elements may need to be shifted.

3. Limitations and Usage:
   Arrays have a fixed size, which can be a limitation when the number of employees grows dynamically. They are suitable when the number of elements is known in advance and relatively static.
