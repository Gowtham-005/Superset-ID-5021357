1. Sorting Algorithms:
   - Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n). It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two halves, then recursively sorts the subarrays.

2. Time Complexity Comparison:
   - Bubble Sort: O(n^2) for all cases (best, average, worst)
   - Quick Sort: 
     - Best Case: O(n log n) 
     - Average Case: O(n log n)
     - Worst Case: O(n^2) (rare, occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot)

3. Preference:
   Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort due to its more efficient average-case time complexity and scalability with larger datasets.
