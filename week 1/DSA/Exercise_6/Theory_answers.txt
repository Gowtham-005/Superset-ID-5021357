1. Search Algorithms:
   - Linear Search: Iterates through each element until the desired one is found. Time complexity is O(n).
   - Binary Search: Requires the dataset to be sorted. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. Time complexity is O(log n).

2. Time Complexity Comparison:
   - Linear Search: O(n) (works on unsorted data)
   - Binary Search: O(log n) (requires sorted data for efficiency)

3. When to Use:
   Use Linear Search when the dataset is small or unsorted. Use Binary Search for larger, sorted datasets to take advantage of the logarithmic time complexity.
